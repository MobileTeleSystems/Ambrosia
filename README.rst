.. title

**Ambrosia** is a Python library for A/B tests design, split and effect 
measurement. It provides rich set of methods for conducting full 
A/B test pipeline. 

An experiment design stage is performed using metrics historical data 
which could be processed in both forms of pandas and spark dataframes 
with either theoretical or empirical approach. 

Group split methods support different strategies and multi-group split, 
which allows to quickly create control and test groups of interest. 

Final effect measurement stage is conducted via testing tools that 
are able to return relative and absolute effects and construct corresponding 
confidence intervalsfor continious and binary variables. 
Testing tools as well as design ones support significant number of 
statistical criteria, like t-test, non-parametric, and bootstrap. 

For additional A/B tests support library provides features and tools 
for data preproccesing and experiment acceleration.
