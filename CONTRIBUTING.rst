Contributing Guide 
===================

`Ambrosia` is an open source project and there are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, 
improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated 
into `Ambrosia` itself.

Bug reports
-----------

If you think you have found a bug in `Ambrosia`, first make sure that you are testing against 
the latest version of package - your issue may already have been fixed. If not, 
search our issues list on GitHub in case a similar issue has already been opened.

It is very helpful if you can prepare a reproduction of the bug. 
In other words, provide a small test case which we can run to confirm your bug. 
It makes it easier to find the problem and to fix it. 

Provide as much information as you can. The easier it is for us to recreate your problem,
the faster it is likely to be fixed.

Feature requests
----------------

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in `Ambrosia`, you can open an issue 
on our `issues list   <https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/Ambrosia/issues>`_ on GitHub 
which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.


Contributing code and documentation changes
-------------------------------------------

If you have a bugfix or new feature that you would like to contribute to `Ambrosia`, 
please find or open an issue about it first. Talk about what you would like to do. 
It may be that somebody is already working on it, 
or that there are particular issues that you should know about before implementing the change.

There are many approaches to fixing a problem and it is important to find the best approach 
before writing too much code.

Branching
---------

Those users with Contributor permissions can directly clone the repository and work on a branch within it.

Those without Contibutor permissions will need to fork the main repository to work on your changes. 
Simply navigate to our GitHub page and click the “Fork” button at the top. 
Once you have forked the repository, you can clone your new repository and start making edits.

When using git, it is best to isolate each topic or feature into a “topic branch”. 
Branches are a great way to group commits related to one feature together, 
or to isolate different efforts when you might be working on multiple topics at the same time.

While it takes some experience to get the right feel about how to break up commits, 
a topic branch should be limited in scope to a single issue. If you are working on multiple issues, 
please create multiple branches and submit them for review separately.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Create a pull request for preliminary review or merging into the project when you are ready.

If you need to make any adjustments to your pull request, just push the updates to your branch. 
Your pull request will automatically track the changes on your development branch and update.

You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, 
or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you. 
We expect to have a minimum of one approval from someone else on the core team.
